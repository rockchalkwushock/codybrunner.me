It has been a while since I last wrote, looking at it now I see it's been about a month. A lot has happened, and not, in that time period. The most important thing to have occurred is taking the step to get the help that I needed for my mental health. I also turned 30 and made a conscious decision to grow up and act like a 30 year old man with my mental and emotional stability instead of acting like a 12 year old pre-pubescent boy, squeaking voice included. There have been trips to see a psychiatrist for medication, counseling both group and individual, and coming to terms with my own demons by acknowledging I can't change what has happened. To be honest I've grown more since 2018 than I have in the last 30 years as a human being. I still have a very very long way to go though, so no there won't be any need for applause or congratulations just yet.

## YouTube

Amazingly enough I started a YouTube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZgBTMhX7jZTkbm7Fpv2bWw?view_as=subscriber) after a year of being terrified to do so. Funny thing of it is I hit publish and the sky didn't fall :flushed:. It's nothing much yet just a few command line tutorials and a video on using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). I'm working on a git tutorial as well as my own little basics of JavaScript series. I can sympathize with Stephen Grider now...it is so hard to talk and code at the same time!

## Employment

Seeking employment as a web developer has been my primary goal directly behind "owning my shit". A conversation with my aunt while in Denver for ElixirDaze led me to start looking for non-profit organizations I could go to work for to start building professional experience. A tweet led me to an opportunity with a team of developers for refactoring the [High Fives Foundation](https://highfivesfoundation.org/) website.

Through a serendipitous chance I was contacted about freelance work on another non-profit product through the company [BothOfUs](http://bothofus.se/). I am very happy and abundantly grateful when I say:

It has been quite a journey just to get to this point in my career as a web developer. I remember sitting on the shore of Elliot Bay in Seattle watching the sunset nearly 2 years ago when I made the decision to pursue web development after leaving my job. I wrote the following words in my journal this morning before signing my contract to keep things in perspective and make a pact to myself:

> I will be grateful for the opportunity and make the most of it to grow as a professional, a developer, and a person.

I'm cramming on [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) now so I can jump in and begin contributing as fast as possible and I must say I am digging on Vue :tada: :sunglasses:. There is a lot I want to do and have planned outside of work and still searching for a full-time developer gig. Most of all I keep working on me and my mindset. I still have so much to learn and get better at with myself, it's important to me because of the damage I've done to myself and my relationships. Employment is a positive step in the right direction and will fuel my stride moving forward. Be thankful, grateful, and keep on grinding for what you want in life.
